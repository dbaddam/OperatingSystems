Problem 1:
   What happens if I give 

 sanitize_directory("/", path);
 is_directory(path);

Problem 2:
   read from /usr/kishan.txt

Problem 3:
   handle ./a.out
   handle ./

Problem 4:
   What happens if I give '..' in sanitize_path()

   Expected output - getcwd + go back one level.
Problem 5:
   printf check - Start after fgets() in cat to debug
Problem 6:
   Handle backspace in ui_input

********************************************************************
Problem 1 :
  When running 'ls /usr', we are getting
  'dinesh dinesh dinesh reddy kishan.txt' as output

Problem 2 :
  ls from root not working
  'ls /' should return all the directories/files in the root.
  At this point nothing is getting printed.

Problem 3:
  Handle '//'

Problem 4:
  Should not use any local char array in tarfs/elf64

Problem 5:
   Provide a function given a file name and content,
   is it an elf64 file?

Problem 6:
   elf_type LOAD, Should we load only when LOAD is set?
   Read DOC and in pheader code check if we only need to LOAD
